# 3. Introduction
Extreme heat is a rising public health and urban planning concern in cities across the United States. It can cause physiological stress, particularly for pedestrians forced to wait in full sun without access to shade, water, or cooling infrastructure. In cities like Austin, Texas – where summer temperatures frequently exceed 100°F (37.8°C) – these risks are most severe for transit-dependent individuals, older adults, outdoor workers, and low-income residents [City of Austin, 2021; Anderson and Bell, 2009; Vargo et al., 2016].
Intersections – especially those near bus stops, schools, and commercial corridors – are among the most sun-exposed and least shaded public spaces [Hoffman et al., 2020; Middel et al., 2018]. These locations function as critical heat exposure nodes, forcing pedestrians to remain in direct solar radiation during peak hours. This not only creates a health hazard but also reduces walkability and discourages street-level economic activity [Hartz et al., 2006; Sailor, 2014].
While cities have promoted tree planting and green infrastructure, these solutions face substantial constraints: long maturation timelines, limited soil volume, drought stress, and conflicts with underground utilities [Shashua-Bar et al., 2011; Nowak and Greenfield, 2018]. Built interventions like bus shelters or kiosks are often infeasible on narrow sidewalks due to ADA clearance requirements, wind loading risks, or right-of-way limitations [Wilhelmi and Hayden, 2010; Vargo et al., 2016].
This proposal introduces a novel intervention class: stoplight-mounted shade (SMS) structures – modular, cantilevered canopies retrofitted onto existing traffic signal poles. Designed for rapid deployment in constrained urban settings, SMS structures provide localized cooling while preserving sidewalk access and signal visibility [Jesdale et al., 2013; Sailor, 2014].
Beyond thermal relief, SMS may advance broader public goals. By improving shade coverage at intersections, these structures could enhance foot traffic, support small businesses, offer platforms for signage or public art, and improve perceived safety – especially in underserved neighborhoods [Hoffman et al., 2020; Wilhelmi and Hayden, 2010]. Rather than replacing trees or infrastructure-scale cooling systems, SMS is intended to complement them where other options are impractical.
This research draws from interdisciplinary literature in urban climatology, thermal comfort, structural engineering, and environmental justice [Shashua-Bar et al., 2011; Sailor, 2014; Jesdale et al., 2013; Vargo et al., 2016]. Its aim is to evaluate whether SMS can serve as a scalable, equitable, and technically feasible solution for intersection-level pedestrian heat mitigation.
Research Gaps
Lack of evaluation frameworks for pole-mounted shade retrofits:
No published framework evaluates cantilevered shade structures mounted on traffic signal poles [Shashua-Bar et al., 2011; Sailor, 2014].


Limited intersection-level thermal exposure data for constrained public rights-of-way:
Most urban heat data are aggregated at coarse spatial scales and overlook sidewalk-level conditions [Hoffman et al., 2020; Jesdale et al., 2013].


Insufficient integration of equity metrics in passive cooling infrastructure planning:
While equity is often cited in urban heat plans, it is rarely operationalized in shade placement or design [Vargo et al., 2016; Wilhelmi and Hayden, 2010].
