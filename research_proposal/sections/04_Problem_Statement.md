4. Problem Statement
Urban signalized intersections expose pedestrians to elevated mean radiant temperatures (MRT) due to the lack of effective shade infrastructure [Li, 2023]. Conventional interventions – such as tree planting, bus shelters, or shade kiosks – are frequently infeasible in these spaces due to spatial, financial, or regulatory constraints [EPA Stormwater Trees Memo, 2016; Access Board, n.d.]. This project investigates whether modular, pole-mounted canopies can provide measurable thermal and behavioral benefits in such constrained environments.
Although the concept of retrofitting shade onto existing traffic poles may appear straightforward, to our knowledge – based on review of published literature and municipal program reports – no major U.S. city has deployed this solution at scale. This absence likely reflects a combination of perceived barriers: structural integrity under wind loading, risks of visual obstruction for drivers, concerns that shade might encourage unsafe pedestrian positioning near curbs, and uncertainty about the effectiveness of fixed structures given the variability of solar angles throughout the day. In the absence of real-world pilots or evaluation data, these concerns – combined with cost and liability considerations – have likely discouraged experimentation. This study aims to test these concerns directly rather than treat them as fixed constraints.
