# **1. Abstract**
Extreme heat presents increasing risks for pedestrians, particularly at signalized intersections where individuals often wait in direct sunlight with no shade available. These exposure nodes create acute thermal burdens â€“ especially for transit users and residents in underserved neighborhoods. This study investigates the viability of stoplight-mounted shade (SMS) structures: modular, cantilevered canopies retrofitted onto existing traffic signal poles to deliver localized cooling. Rather than replacing trees or large-scale infrastructure, SMS offers a rapid, low-cost intervention suited to constrained urban environments. Integrating research from urban climatology, behavioral science, health equity, and infrastructure feasibility, this proposal identifies key research questions and evaluation criteria to assess SMS effectiveness. The study will examine potential impacts on thermal comfort, pedestrian behavior, and equity-focused siting strategies, using both empirical data and modeling. Findings are intended to inform municipal decision-making, support design standards for pole-mounted shade retrofits, and establish a replicable framework for deployment in other heat-vulnerable cities. The aim is to support city-scale strategies for intersection-level heat mitigation where exposure, equity, and feasibility intersect.
