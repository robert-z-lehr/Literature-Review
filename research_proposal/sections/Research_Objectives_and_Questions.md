# 5. Research Objectives and Questions
This study evaluates the viability of stoplight-mounted shade (SMS) structures as a scalable, equitable intervention to reduce pedestrian heat exposure at intersections.

## 5.1 Core Objectives
Simulate structural, thermal, and behavioral conditions of a model SMS unit.


Identify constraints – structural, spatial, and regulatory – that affect feasibility.


Quantify thermal performance (e.g. MRT, WBGT, UTCI, heat index) under simulated and real conditions.


Assess pedestrian perceptions of the utility, comfort, safety, and aesthetics of SMS.


Develop a GIS-based deployment framework aligned with city equity goals, climate plans, and right-of-way regulations.


Evaluate the social return on investment (SROI) of SMS relative to other interventions, like tree planting, kiosks, or cool paint?.


To address these objectives, the following research questions are grouped by timeframe:

## 5.2 Phase 1 Research Questions
By how much does MRT decrease beneath SMS compared to unshaded sidewalk areas?


How do material selection, mounting angle, surface geometry, and surface types influence MRT?


What structural, spatial, or regulatory barriers limit SMS retrofits to which existing traffic poles in Austin?


How do pedestrians perceive SMS in terms of comfort, safety, aesthetics, and usefulness relative to current urban infrastructure?


Which public spatial datasets – like heat vulnerability indices or pedestrian volumes – are available and useful for SMS deployment planning?

## 5.3 Phase 2 Research Questions
Number of pedestrians exposed to SMS structures across urban blocks, relative to block population?


Which design/material adaptations allow SMS to meet ASCE 7‑22 structural criteria while remaining cost-effective?

## 5.4 Postdoctoral or Future Research Questions
Can SMS placement be optimized using predictive models of pedestrian flow, solar geometry, and microclimate data?


How can SMS units be integrated with environmental sensors, public art, lighting, or emergency infrastructure?


What long-term health or behavioral outcomes arise from reductions in pedestrian heat exposure due to SMS?


What governance and procurement models support city, state, or national deployment of retrofitted shade infrastructure?
What policy, logistical, or financial challenges affect citywide SMS integration?
