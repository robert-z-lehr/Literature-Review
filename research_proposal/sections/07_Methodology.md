# 7. Methodology

## 7.1 Modeling & Structural Analysis (Years 1 – 2)
The project begins with computational modeling to define performance targets and inform the design of prototype shade systems. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, ANSYS Fluent, and GIS-based solar modeling, I will simulate mean radiant temperature, airflow, and shading geometries across various seasons and material properties. Simultaneously, structural viability will be tested using ASCE 7-22 load standards and finite-element analysis to ensure brackets, arms, and fabric components meet wind-load requirements – pending any higher local thresholds, such as the City of Austin’s requirement of ice and 80 mph winds with 104 mph gusts, per the most current AASHTO Standard Specifications for Structural Supports for Highway Signs, Luminaires and Traffic Signals (Austin Standard Specifications, §839). All designs will be refined in dialogue with licensed structural engineering faculty.

## 7.2 Field-Based Thermal Validation and GIS-Guided Deployment (Years 2 – 4)
Following simulations, the thermal performance of prototypes will be validated in the field using black globe thermometers, pyranometers, and MRT sensors during peak exposure hours (1 – 5 PM) at matched intersections. These measurements will be cross-validated against simulated expectations. Behavioral responses will be assessed via intercept surveys capturing perceptions of comfort, safety, and shade-induced utility. Deployment priorities will be identified using GIS-overlay analysis of transit reliance, MRT exposure, pedestrian density, and sidewalk width, with an equity lens informed by archived tools like EJSCREEN. Key evaluation criteria include achieving a mean radiant temperature reduction of 10 °C (18°F) or more, demonstrable behavioral shifts, structural compliance, and equity-aligned siting. The 10 °C MRT reduction target reflects a drop in radiant heat shown in field studies (e.g., Middel et al. 2016) to produce measurable improvements in outdoor comfort, and matches thresholds identified in recent microclimate research (López-Ordoñez et al. 2025) as sufficient to shift conditions from strong to moderate heat stress.
