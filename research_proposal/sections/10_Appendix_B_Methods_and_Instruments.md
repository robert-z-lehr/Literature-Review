Appendix B - Methods & Instruments

Method / Tool
Purpose in this study
Stage / When
CFD & radiative transfer simulations (COMSOL, ANSYS; GIS-based solar modeling)
Predict MRT, shading footprints, and airflow across seasons/materials; set performance targets and guide geometry.
Phase 1 (7.1)
ASCE 7-22 load analysis
Establish wind load demands for the retrofit context (exposure category, importance, load combos).
Phase 1 (7.1)
Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
Verify bracket/arm/fabric stresses, deflection, fatigue risk, and safety factors under wind and service loads.
Phase 1 (7.1)
Prototype design iteration with licensed SE faculty
Translate simulation findings into safe, buildable retrofit details; confirm code compliance.
Phase 1 (7.1)
Field thermal measurements (black globe, pyranometer, MRT setup)
Empirically compare shaded vs control sites during peak hours; cross-validate against simulations.
Phase 2 (7.2)
Intercept surveys
Capture perceived comfort, safety, and utility changes attributable to SMS.
Phase 2 (7.2)
GIS weighted overlay (incl. EJSCREEN or archived equivalent)
Prioritize deployments by transit reliance, MRT exposure, pedestrian density, sidewalk width, and equity metrics.
Phase 2 (7.2)
Evaluation against success criteria
Confirm ≥10 °C MRT reduction, observe behavioral shifts, verify structural compliance, and equity-aligned siting.
Phase 2 (7.2)
